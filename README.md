# MvcWithNetStandard

ASP.NET MVC 5.x Referencing netstandard (msbuild error)

Code in this repository was created for my blog post [MsBuild error publishing ASP.NET MVC referencing .NET Standard library](https://www.seeleycoder.com/blog/aspnet-netstandard-msbuild-error/)

The premise of this project is to show two things about an ASP.NET MVC web application 4.7 or lower targeting netstandard 2.0.
1) It can build/publish properly through Visual Studio but will fail in msbuild from command prompt.
2) There is a way to fix it.
